# React-Tenzies-game  

A easy but interesting game build by React, lerning from a popular toturial of React in YouTube.  
Click "roll" to ramdomly innitialize all unlocked dice, click dice to lock/unlock it. When all dices are the same, game over.  
Very helpful to learn features and functions of React and JavaScript.
